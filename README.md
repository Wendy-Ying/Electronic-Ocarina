# Electroni Ocarina
This project is based on our open source project “imitation 'ocarina' electronic wind instrument ”, reproduce and add functionality to achieve the electronic ocarina. 

The repository is in https://oshwhub.com/dr.zhang/Totoro

It is based on ESP32, with airflow detection, key detection, sound output, status alerts four modules. It can imitate the function of ocarina, controlled by blowing air and pressing keys, imitate the fingering table of ocarina, and have the sound volume and pitch output based on Midi protocol and the light band output on WS2812.

I am responsible for the software part of the project, including system environment construction, implementation of the open source code, tuning pitch control, expanding the range function, and light band output function.
